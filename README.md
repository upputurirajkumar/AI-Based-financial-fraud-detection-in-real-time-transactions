🔍 Project Overview

**Title:** AI-Based Financial Fraud Detection in Real-Time Transactions

This project aims to tackle the growing threat of financial fraud by designing an AI-driven system capable of detecting suspicious financial transactions in real time, using a combination of anomaly detection and classification models.

🧠 Problem Statement

Traditional rule-based or manual fraud detection systems struggle to handle:

* Increasing volume and complexity of transactions
* Evolving fraud tactics
* High false-positive rates and inefficiency

Existing models like Dense Neural Networks (DNNs), while powerful, are resource-intensive and less interpretable—making them suboptimal for real-time deployment.

🚀 Proposed Solution

A **hybrid AI model** that combines:

1. **Autoencoder** for unsupervised anomaly detection
2. **Random Forest Classifier** for robust, accurate classification
3. **Risk-Based Approach** to prioritize high-risk transactions for manual review

Key Advantages:

* High accuracy and precision
* Scalability and efficiency
* Better interpretability for decision-making

⚙️ Implementation Modules

1. **Admin Module** – Manages system settings, users, and reports.
2. **User Module** – Allows customers to view transactions and receive alerts.
3. **Fraud Detection Module** – Core engine using Autoencoder + RF Classifier.
4. **Reporting Module** – Generates analytics and compliance reports.

🧪 Technologies Used

**Programming & Frameworks:**

* Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
* Django for backend
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend

**Machine Learning Models:**

* Autoencoder (Anomaly Detection)
* Random Forest Classifier
* Dense Neural Networks (for comparison)

**Tools & Platforms:**

* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* SQLite3 Database
* Django Admin Interface

📈 Real-Time Use Cases

* **Banking & Financial Services:** Fraud detection in credit/debit card transactions
* **E-commerce Platforms:** Spotting fake orders or refund scams
* **Regulatory Compliance:** Supporting AML and KYC operations
* **Cybersecurity:** Identifying unauthorized access and transaction anomalies

🧪 Testing & Evaluation

### Model Performance:

* The Random Forest classifier outperformed DNN in accuracy, interpretability, and speed.
* Evaluation metrics included: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score**, and **Confusion Matrix**.

### System Testing:

* Functional testing (Login, alerts)
* Model validation (False positives/negatives)
* Load and stress testing for performance
* Fairness and bias analysis



📊 Results

* **High accuracy** in detecting fraudulent transactions with minimal false alarms
* **Real-time prediction capability** with optimized resource usage
* The proposed model ensures **better scalability** and **interpretability** than traditional DNN approaches



## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Integrating blockchain for immutable transaction logging
* Expanding detection to include multi-channel financial frauds
* Continuous learning with real-world feedback loops
* Integration with real-time APIs for broader deployment
